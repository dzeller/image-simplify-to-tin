Josh Imhoff, Daniel Zeller, Michael Croteau

Project is composed of six pieces:
1. JPGtoASC.py -- converts a jpeg into a grid-like file
    NOTE running JPGtoASC.py requires JES
2. grid.h/c -- store rgb image as a grid
3. pqueue.h/c -- an implementation of a generic priority queue
4. llist.h/c -- an implementation of a generic linked list
5. simplification.h/c  -- the grid-to-tin greedy insertion simplifier
6. display.h/c -- the OpenGL tin painter for displaying results

We have included a variety of images to be run as tests in the project directory.
More can be created using JPGtoASC.py.

Must have Glut installed.
Build by running 'make.'
Execute program by running 'simplify [.asc filename] [epsilon (double)].'

Project is 1400 lines long.
